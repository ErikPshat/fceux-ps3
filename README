SOURCE CODE REPOSITORY
========================
This release corresponds with revision = 92da225e5a	

Source code repository is here:

https://code.google.com/p/fceu-ps3/


COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS
========================
NOTE: ONLY FOLLOW STEP 1 IF YOU HAVE SDK 1.92 OR LOWER
1 - Edit the Makefile and remove the following from PPU_CXX_FLAGS and PPU_CFLAGS:

-DPS3_SDK_3_41

3 - Do 'make clean && make && make pkg'


CURRENTLY KNOWN ISSUES (v1.3)
========================
* PAL games do not run properly.
* Please start reporting them on the google code bug tracker


HD TV USERS
========================
* For people running this on HDTVs complaining about input lag:
- Turn off all post-processing filters you may have running - on Sony Bravia HDTVs, display Motion Flow (this also causes input lags
with most games in general, not just this SNES emu. If your HDTV has a 'Game' mode or something of the sort, select that as well.


PERFORMANCE NOTES
========================
* Stock shader will run all games at 60fps.
* Some shaders are very taxing currently.
* PAL runs way to fast.


PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS
========================
- GameGenie
- Pretty GUI.


SPECIAL THANKS
